### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an open source programmer and a polyglot working on building a variety of tools. 

My main programming languages are 

- Java
- C
- C++
- Python
- Javascript

While all my contributions are marked and managed via this profile to upstreams with PRs, a bunch of my own repositories have been migrated to [grookage](https://github.com/grookage) and managed there.
