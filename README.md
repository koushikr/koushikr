### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About me

My name is Koushik. I'm a computer science engineer from Bangalore, India. 

The programming languages I often use are, 

- Java
- C
- C++
- Python
- Javascript

While all my contributions are marked and managed, a bunch of my other repos also exist at [grookage](https://github.com/grookage) and managed there. 

### About Grookage

[Grookage](https://github.com/grookage) is a collection of software applications predominantly written in Java, useful as building blocks to setup an Internet company. 

The various ideas include (not limited to)

- Solving for easy-to-use state machines and workflow engines
- Wrappers around using messaging queues to get started with async workflows
- Building blocks to setup middlewares and API proxies - with sync and async http clients
- Utilitarian offerings such as a maker-checker service with multiple repository bindings, a cataloging and dynamic discovery offering, an http backed data refresher, a DSL on top of elasticsearch queries useful for building custom UIs. 
- Performance Engineering tools like Chaos Monkey equivalents
- Data Governance offerings, such as clean data rooms, schema registries and schema transformers with message demultiplexing support.
- A scratchy, experimental relational database written in C++

The list may grow with time, and I'll try to add to the list of offerings. Please fork and submit an MR for any bugs/improvements/feature-additions and so on. Cheers!
